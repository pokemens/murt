Hey! You found the repo! 

Here are some fun facts about the project: 

-The character's original name was almost "Babak"

-This was created because the creator felt his brain atrophying looking at derivative-of-derivative projects on DEX. He wanted to create something new, with a real movement, and a real mission. 

-If the Nintendo doesn't adopt Murt, we might create a new character universe around him. The characters will all be similarly peculiar.   

-Where do we go if Nintendo adopts the creature? We go from a Babak advocacy group to a Babak appreciation group :)

Thank you to all Believers of Murt
