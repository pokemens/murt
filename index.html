            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>This is an experiment in reverse memecoin activism. Instead of corporations creating mascots that become memecoins, we're pushing for a community-created character to be adopted by Nintendo as an official Pokémon. We are determined to make this happen.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="rainbow-text">The Concept</h2>
        <p>Murt represents a dual-type Psychic/Dragon Pokémon, designed with careful consideration of Pokémon's established universe. As shown in the image above, its unique characteristics include shimmering scales and a radiant aura that would complement existing Pokémon designs.</p>

        <h2>Community Movement</h2>
        <p>As die-hard Pokémon fans since the original Red and Blue releases, we're committed to demonstrating that community-driven character creation can flow upward to official adoption, rather than the traditional top-down approach seen in memecoin culture.</p>

        <div class="legal">
            <h2>IP Rights Declaration</h2>
            <p>We, the creators and community behind Murt, hereby explicitly waive all intellectual property rights, copyrights, and trademarks related to Murt, transferring them unconditionally to Nintendo Corporation and The Pokémon Company for their unrestricted use. This includes all design elements, characteristics, and concept details presented here.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>This initiative represents a new model of community-corporate interaction. Instead of appropriating corporate IP for crypto projects, we're offering our creative work to enhance an established franchise we love. This is about building bridges between passionate fans and the companies that create the games we cherish.</p>

        <div class="mission">
            <h2>Join The Movement</h2>
            <p>Telegram and X (Twitter) communities launching soon. The internet's about to witness something unprecedented.</p>
